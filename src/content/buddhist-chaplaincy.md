## Buddhist Chaplaincy

I have a Master of Divinity in Buddhist Chaplaincy from [University of the West](https://www.uwest.edu/), a beautiful community of teachers and students from all walks of life and one of very few accredited programs in the US offering this degree.

During my time there I had the opportunity to learn with and from my cohort, and to volunteer as a chaplain at a California state prison. Although I'm not acting as a chaplain at this point in my life it's something I'm planning to return to down the line.

Here is a recording of a Dharma talk I gave as part of the program, interpreting the [Ariyapariyesana Sutta](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.026.than.html) from the Pali Canon.
