## Music

Over the years I've composed for, led, and performed in a variety of groups, ranging in style from grotesque synth pop to chamber music.

### Maggots and Men

In 2009 I was fortunate and honored to write the score for Cary Cronenwett's gorgeous award-winning film Maggots and Men. It's a stylized depiction of the Kronstadt Uprising of 1921, inspired by classic films like Battleship Potemkin, and featured the largest cast of trans actors in film history.

### Moss Lords, The Jascha Ephraim Memorial Library, etc.

For years I had an ensemble whose name and instrumentation changed frequently. At its largest it was a twelve-piece group including a concert harp. For quite a while it was a string quartet along with me and my singing partner Jessy Brown. Here are some videos of its various incarnations in reverse chronological order.
