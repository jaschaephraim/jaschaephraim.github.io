Software engineer and engineering director, composer, filmmaker, and former Buddhist chaplain.

My most recent work was as an individual contributor on a team prototyping a suite of AI productivity tools. I'm on the lookout for a long-term professional home where I can contribute to building software development teams that are productive, constructive, and fulfilling.
