### A Living Olympus

In 2008 with assistance from the San Francisco Film Foundation I wrote, directed, and produced a film called A Living Olympus. It featured an incredible set designed and built by many talented artists and my original score performed by equally talented musicians. Unfortunately the film never made it through the post-production phase, but the trailer is still available on Vimeo.

### 3D Business Trip

In 2005 I made a movie shot entirely on MiniDV telling the story of my North American Amtrak tour along with my partner at the time. It depicted the trials and tribulations of touring and my performances interspersed with music videos. The original screening was at [Artists' Television Access](https://www.atasite.org/) in SF, featuring innovative 3D technology where I would personally dance in the faces of viewers. It's not currently available to stream or purchase, but there are still some DVDs floating around out there.
